# AI-Powered System Proposal for CV Management and Customization in Public Tender Processes

## Project Objective
The goal is to develop an AI-based system that enables us to:
- Centrally collect and manage collaborator CVs
- Automatically analyze tender documents to understand the requested CVs with their requirements 
- Analyze the CV saved in the company database, and on the base of the tender document, select the best experts meeting the requirements
- Generate customized CVs aligned with the specific requirements of each tender
- (Optional) Provide an easy-to-use interface for continuous CV updates

## 1. CV Collection and Centralized Repository

### Description
All collaborator CVs will be stored in a centralized repository, organized into two categories: internal and external collaborators. Files should be uploaded in a standard format (PDF or Word) and ideally accompanied by key metadata (e.g., name, role, core skills).

## 2. Automatic Selection of the Most Suitable Professional Profile

### Description
When the company decides to participate in a tender, the main tender document (e.g., Terms of Reference â€“ TOR or equivalent) is uploaded into the system. The AI engine analyzes the content and compares it with the database of available CVs to identify the most suitable candidate(s) based on the requirements.

### Required Features
- Parsing and semantic understanding of the tender document
- Automatic extraction of key requirements (e.g., years of experience, sector expertise, required roles, technical skills)
- Prepare a table summarizing the list of the required staff and its requirements
- Intelligent matching between tender requirements and stored profiles
- Ranked list of the best-matching candidates, including compatibility scores

## 3. Automated CV Customization Based on the Tender

### Description
Once the most suitable professional profile is identified, the system generates a customized CV that highlights the experiences, skills, and keywords most relevant to the tender specifications.

### Required Features
- Automated generation of a customized CV with a fixed standard layout
- Highlighting of relevant experiences and qualifications
- Use of keywords directly extracted from the tender document
- Final CV export in PDF format, ready for submission
- Optional manual content editing through a simple and guided interface, ensuring the layout and formatting remain intact

## 4. (Optional) Interface for Ongoing CV Updates

### Description
An easy-to-use tool would be beneficial to allow continuous CV updates. This could be a web interface that guides the user (or a designated HR/admin figure) in updating the professional profile according to a predefined company template.

### Suggested Features
- Secure login access for each collaborator or HR representative
- Guided form for entering new projects, courses, certifications, or experiences
- Automatic synchronization with the central database

## Expected System Outputs
- Customized and optimized CVs in PDF format for each tender
- Smart search and filtering system for internal professional profiles
- Administrative panel to monitor candidate selections and manually adjust parameters if needed
- (Optional) Web interface for collaborators to update and manage their CVs
